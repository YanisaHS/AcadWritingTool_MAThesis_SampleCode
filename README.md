# *Your Academic Writing Friend* Tool - Sample Code from MA Thesis project (Fall 2020 - Spring 2021)

This repo consists of several sample files I wrote for the development of *Your Academic Writing Friend*, which is a project I am working on for my MA Thesis at the University of Alabama, MA in Applied Linguistics/TESOL program.

*Note: This repo is not actively being developed, and these files were uploaded for demonstration purposes only. If you would like more information on my work or on this specific project, please send me an email at ykhaley@crimson.ua.edu.*
